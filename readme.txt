== Description ==

This plugin is used to display a notification on the header of the site when there is [Livestream.com](http://livestream.com) event scheduled or live on a specific account (doesn't have to be your own). When the event is live, the bar contains a link to the event page. When the event has been scheduled, it displays a countdown until it goes live and then changes to a link. All options are editable via the WP Customizer.
